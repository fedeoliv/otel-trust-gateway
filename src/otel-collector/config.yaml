  # Memory Limiter Processor
  # Prevents the collector from running out of memory by monitoring and limiting memory usage.
  # - Checks memory usage every 1 second
  # - Sets a soft limit at 80% (~205 MiB) where collector starts refusing new data
  # - Sets a hard limit at 256 MiB where collector forces garbage collection
  # - Spike limit allows temporary bursts up to 64 MiB above the limit
  # - Protects system from OOM crashes, essential for production
  # - Tuned for mobile app traffic (lower memory footprint)

  # Trust Gateway Processor (Custom)
  # Validates authentication tokens and required headers from mobile applications.
  # - Checks that required headers are present in resource attributes
  # - Validates API keys against a whitelist
  # - Rejects telemetry data if validation fails
  # - Acts as a security gateway before data is exported

  # Probabilistic Sampling Processor
  # Samples a percentage of traces to reduce volume sent to Application Insights
  # - sampling_percentage: 10 means keep 10% of traces, drop 90%
  # - Uses trace ID for consistent sampling decisions across distributed traces
  # - All spans in a sampled trace are kept together
  # - Adjust percentage based on your volume needs (1-100)
  # Example: 10% of 1M spans/day = 100K spans/day sent to App Insights
  probabilistic_sampler:
    sampling_percentage: 10

  # Batch Processor (for full data pipeline)
  # Groups telemetry data into batches before sending to exporters for better performance.
  # - Sends batch after 5 seconds even if not full (lower latency for mobile apps)
  # - Sends batch when it reaches 100 spans/metrics/logs
  # - Reduces network calls: 1000 spans = ~10 requests instead of 1000
  # - Improves throughput and reduces CPU usage
  # - Tuned for mobile app traffic (smaller batches, faster send)
