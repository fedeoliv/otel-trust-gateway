  # Memory Limiter Processor
  # Prevents the collector from running out of memory by monitoring and limiting memory usage.
  # - Checks memory usage every 1 second
  # - Sets a soft limit at 80% (~205 MiB) where collector starts refusing new data
  # - Sets a hard limit at 256 MiB where collector forces garbage collection
  # - Spike limit allows temporary bursts up to 64 MiB above the limit
  # - Protects system from OOM crashes, essential for production
  # - Tuned for mobile app traffic (lower memory footprint)

    check_interval: 1s

  # Trust Gateway Processor (Custom)
  # Validates authentication tokens and required headers from mobile applications.
  # - Checks that required headers are present in resource attributes
  # - Validates API keys against a whitelist
  # - Rejects telemetry data if validation fails
  # - Acts as a security gateway before data is exported
  trustgateway:
    # Headers that must be present in the resource attributes

      - "X-App-Token"
      - "X-API-Key"

      - "mobile-app-secret-key-456"

  # Batch Processor
  # Groups telemetry data into batches before sending to exporters for better performance.
  # - Sends batch after 5 seconds even if not full (lower latency for mobile apps)
  # - Sends batch when it reaches 100 spans/metrics/logs
  # - Reduces network calls: 1000 spans = ~10 requests instead of 1000
  # - Improves throughput and reduces CPU usage
  # - Tuned for mobile app traffic (smaller batches, faster send)
